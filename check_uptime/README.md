## Uptime

This plugin display the Uptime in two differant way :
* Date of last boot
* Uptime in an human readable way

This is a exemple of the output of this script :
> Server is up for 168 days 22 hours 45 minutes from 2019-09-21 17:43

The uptime in second is passed to whatever performance data processing it has configured.

Some improvement can be donne.
Here is my task list :
- [x] Get uptime through performance data
- [ ] Add help
- [ ] Allow to add warning and critical threshold
